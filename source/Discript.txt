The engine has 6 files that are compiled together
Create a error allert to prevent any computer crashing or blue screen when the memory is cloged
The six files are:
        1.The engine itself with main function
        2.Defination file, put all the Defination on one file to prevent
            repetation 
        3. board file , it contains the board structure 
        4. data file, keeps the data of the board structure
        5. bitboard file,  does some bitwise calculation 
            AND and OR on the pieces
        init file, creates the hash or position Keys of position

BOARD STRUCTURE

The engine will represent a 120 array board this is due to some move 
of some pieces, this are Knight, Queen, Bishop, King , Rook, and the Pawn
By using the 120 square board this will prevent the pieces from overflowing 
from the board 
The standard chess board is a 8 by 8 board that means it has 64 squares, 
Each position will be indetified by co-ordinates which is used in chess
A file is from A to H and a rank is 1 to 8 when indetifying a position 
(for example D4 position) this is how the computer will keep track of
each position with position Key

The engine should first convert the 120 square board to the 64 square 
board and vice versa using  a macro 

Secondly we need to reset the board to be filled zero
to generate the position Key



BITBOARD

Create an array of 64 elements to be manipulated , we need to create three 
function countBit , popbit and print the board the popping of bit shows that 
the position is set 

Here we are setting the Pawns on the board,to set a pawn we nwwd to shift 1 the
number of time the position                      

INIT

contains many function that have different functionality. In the other file for counting bit
here we will be setting bits and clearing it.
Before we set the bits we need a macro that generate random bits to be filled in the  ussigned 64 bit
integer
